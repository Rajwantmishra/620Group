The dataset is a gml file that contains the names of the books and lists links between books that were bought by the same buyer.  The data set designates each book as being liberal, neutral or conservative.  We will analyze relationships between books bought by the same buyers to identify relationships based on the political sentiment of the book. In addition, we will conduct sentiment analysis to analyze the title of each book to determine if the title is positive or negative.  We will aim to determine if there is a relationship between the political leaning of the book and whether its title is positive or negative.  We will also look for trends amongst buyers of books to see if they cluster by sentiment.  "
