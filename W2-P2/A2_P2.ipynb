The data set was compiled in 2005 by Lada Adamic and Natalie Glance and shared in Proceedings of the WWW-2005 Workshop on the Weblogging Ecosystem (2005).  The blog posts are from the time of the 2004 presidential election.  The nodes in the data set have attributes to designate bloggers as being liberal (0) or conservative (1)."
